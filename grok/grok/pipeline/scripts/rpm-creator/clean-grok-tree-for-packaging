${0} is used by rpm-creator.py to prepare a YOMP checkout of this repo for
packaging.

You almost certainly do not want to run this in your checkout; it deletes
many .py files from the current directory (and all subdirectories) This
is likely to make you very sad if it happens someplace you are doing work.

If you really, *really* want to run it, do:

${0} --destroy-all-my-work

and don't say you weren't warned.
